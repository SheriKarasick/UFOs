# UFOs

## Summary
In this project, JavaScript functions and conditional expressions were implemented to create an interactive tool that allows afficianados of extra-terrestrial sightings to explore a robust database of sightings data by date, city, state, country, and shape sighted.  The JavaScript app was implemented in connection with a BootStrap Web page in a dark theme.  

The end result is a database that is searchable by any combination of the field parameters.
